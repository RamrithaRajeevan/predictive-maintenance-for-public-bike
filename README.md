Predictive Bike Maintenance System
Overview

This project is an predictive maintenance system for bike components.
It uses machine learning to predict whether a component — such as brake, chain, tire, or gear — is likely to fail soon based on usage and stress factors.

The goal is to shift from reactive maintenance (fixing after failure) to predictive maintenance, improving safety, efficiency, and cost savings.
